Final Project for ITBootCamp course


Assignment:

FINAL TEST
Part I (20 points)
For the website https://demoqa.com/, create a test plan in Excel or any preferred editor.
Not every test case needs to be automated.
Create a section for bugs or improvements as needed.
The minimum number of test cases for a passing grade is 5.

Part II (50 points)
Create a new Maven/Java project named ITBC_project_firstname_lastname and include all necessary libraries.
Automate some of the written test cases following these rules:

Mandatory use of the Page Object Model (POM) pattern - element finding and actions on them should not be in the test methods.
Mandatory use of TestNG with appropriate annotations - test setup should not be in the test methods.
The minimum number of automated tests for a passing grade is 5.
Additional 5 points can be earned by using Actions, parameterized tests, or any syntax not covered in the course.
Part III (20 points)
Create a Postman collection for the https://demoqa.com/swagger/#/ API.
Each request must have the URL stored in a variable, dynamically generated data being sent (if applicable), path variables (if any), and verification of the status code and at least one response parameter.
After completion, save the collection by clicking on the three dots next to its name and selecting the Export option.
The minimum number of requests for a passing grade is 5.

Part IV (10 points)
Create a repository on your GitHub account with the same name as the project, and upload the entire project to https://github.com/.
In the project, create an additional folder where you should put the documentation from Part I and the Postman collection from Part III.
Add README.md and .gitignore files.
To consider the project successfully completed, a minimum of Parts I, II, and IV must be completed.
Part III is not mandatory, but without it, the maximum points cannot be achieved.
Although 5 is mentioned as the minimum, create as many test cases as possible.
